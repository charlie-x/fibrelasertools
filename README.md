mopa fibre laser tools

if  i make any tools for our fibre laser i will put them here.


(advaced use, i'd avoid it for now) patchy can change the virtual key codes for the red laser, and the "mark" fibre laser, because by default they use F1 and F2 ! 
 It should work with most versions of EzCad2, i've tried a couple, but be careful and don't use this application at all for anything ever !
Don't use a key thats already in use, patchy isn't able to check for that automatically. There is another spot i have to find that listens to F1 and F2 but if you assign red laser or mark laser to say space bar, that means you don't need to use f1 and f2 together, so assing space to red laser and leave f2 as mark laser or something


EzPenEditor lets you load .EZD files created by EzCAd and lets you edit the pens in a better way, as well as import and export the CSVs, CSV's are currently very specifically setup so don't stray from the layout this software exports :)  Only expected to work with latest version of EzCad. Loading older .EZD files into newer EzCad and re-saving them will update the file. There is no real file format verification here and this is the first version for testing.
