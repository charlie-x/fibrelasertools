mopa fibre laser tools

if  i make any tools for our fibre laser i will put them here.


patchy can change the virtual key codes for the red laser, and the "mark" fibre laser, because by default they use F1 and F2 ! 
 It should work with most versions of EzCad2, i've tried a couple, but be careful and don't use this application at all for anything ever !
